                            The game being referred to is not specified, but based on the provided statistics, it appears to be a basketball game in which Joel Embiid played for approximately 35 minutes. Embiid had an impressive performance, scoring 35 points on 13 out of 19 field goal attempts, making 1 out of 3 three-point attempts and 8 out of 10 free throw attempts. He also grabbed 17 rebounds and dished out 5 assists, but had 3 turnovers and committed 3 personal fouls. Despite Embiid's strong individual performance, his team was trailing by 4 point, suggesting a closely contested game.

                            Joel Embiid attempted 19 shots in the game, and out of those 19 shots, he made 13 of them, resulting in a shooting percentage of 68.4%. To visually represent this, a pie chart can be used to show the percentage of shots made by Embiid.

                            Embiid was dominating in the first half, hitting nine out of eleven, probably the biggest reason for the 76ers 26-point lead. But that was because he was making most of his mid-range jumpers(6/8), which is not very sustainable. He only hit 3/9 in the second half, and none of his shots were near the rim!
